# Blogtrotter

Blogging on the run - snap a photo, write some text and send your note to your blog. 

 * Export notes (photo and text) in JSON format to any website with simple PHP uploader
 * Pin photos to chosen places on map without losing original geotag
 * Pinch to zoom in photo view tab
 * Two modes of acquiring maps - Google Maps API and HTTP request
